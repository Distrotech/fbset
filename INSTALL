			FBSET INSTALLATION GUIDE


Change the current directory to the directory containing the fbset sources and
type

    make install

This will create the fbset binary and install it, together with the manual
pages. It also creates the standard frame buffer special device nodes.


The etc subdirectory contains sample frame buffer mode definitions files. Copy
one of them to /etc/fb.modes and edit it to your needs.


Enjoy!
